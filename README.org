* Code Explanation

This code is written in C and uses the PulseAudio library to generate and play a sound.

** Header Files and Constants

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include <config.h>
#endif

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <math.h>

#include <pulse/simple.h>
#include <pulse/error.h>

#define BUFSIZE 1024
#define PI 3.14159265
#define SAMPLE_RATE 44100
#define SLEEP_DURATION 60
#+END_SRC

The code starts by including necessary header files and defining constants. The config.h file is included if it exists. This is a common practice in open source projects to handle different build configurations.

The constants BUFSIZE, PI, SAMPLE_RATE, and SLEEP_DURATION are defined for later use in the program.

** Sound Frame Structure

#+BEGIN_SRC c
struct SoundTrame
{
    int size;
    short *trame;
    int next;
};
#+END_SRC

This structure is used to store a sound frame, with information about its size, the frame data itself, and an index for the next element.

** Sine Wave Generation

#+BEGIN_SRC c
short *sineWave(int frequency, int maxVolume)
#+END_SRC

This function generates a sine wave of a specified frequency and volume. The wave is generated for a duration of one second, with a sample rate defined by SAMPLE_RATE.

** Sound Frame Creation

#+BEGIN_SRC c
struct SoundTrame trame(int start, short *sample, int sampleSize)
#+END_SRC

This function creates a SoundTrame structure from a given sample array. The SoundTrame structure contains a portion of the sample array starting from a specified index. The size of the portion is determined by the BUFSIZE constant.

** Sound Playback

#+BEGIN_SRC c
int playsound(short *sample)
#+END_SRC

This function plays a sound sample using the PulseAudio library. The sound sample is divided into frames using the trame function, and each frame is played back using the pa_simple_write function from the PulseAudio library.

** Main Function

#+BEGIN_SRC c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
#+END_SRC

This is the main function of the program. It generates a sine wave, then enters an infinite loop where it plays the sound and then sleeps for a duration defined by SLEEP_DURATION.
